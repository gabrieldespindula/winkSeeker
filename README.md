Sometimes is hard to find IoTs running a webserver inside a local network. This project tries to make it simple

Unfortunatelly is not possible to go around the mixed content issue. However is possible to clone this repository and run it using the python sandbox. Other solution is to disable mixed content and open the link bellow.

ATTENTION! the git page bellow doesn't work unless mixed content protection is disabled in your browser.
The code is running in this page: https://gabrieldespindula.github.io/winkSeeker/
